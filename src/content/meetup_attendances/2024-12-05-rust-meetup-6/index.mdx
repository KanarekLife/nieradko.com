Another week and another Rust Gdańsk meetup!

The meeting took place in [DevONE Hub](https://devone.com.pl/) owned by Dynatrace. The number of people attending was quite low and consisted mostly of regulars. The atmosphere was great though and you could feel that everyone was excited to be there.

## Presentations

During the meetup there was only one presentation given:

- **Sylvia Framewrok: Reducing CosmWasm Smart Contracts boilerplate with procedural macros** by Bartłomiej Kuras

The presentation was quite technical and definitely not for beginners (despite what the presenter said XD). It focused on presenter's experience while writing framework for building smart contracts with Rust. As the presenter said, the framework was designed to be as much user friendly and as native to rust as possible which caused quite a lot of different difficulties. During the presentation we heard a lot of interesting stories, problems and solutions to these issues. Most of them, naturally, involved procedural macros and despite the fact that I am not a great rust developer and I don't know much about procedural macros, I found the presentation quite interesting.

## Networking

After the presentation naturally there was some time for discussions, food and drinks. The atmosphere was even better when everyone's favorite part of the meetup started - the quiz! This time the quiz was a bit easier than the previous ones but it still proved to be too difficult for me. I hope to get better at this in the future and practice more during the next meetup, which are said to take place next year.

## Summary

I think the meetup was great and I am looking forward to the next one. There is always something new to be learned and I think that it's a great environment to deepen your knowledge of the language and other related things. I look forward towards the next meetup and hope to attend as much of these as it's possible next year.
