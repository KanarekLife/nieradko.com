I have recently attended another Rust Gdańsk Meetup and it was a blast!

The meetup took place in [Air Space Intelligence](https://www.airspace-intelligence.com/), a company that specializes in air related software.
They have a really nice office and the atmosphere was great. There was a lot of food and drinks, many of which were non-alcoholic, which was a very important for me personally.

## Presentations

During the meetup there was only one presentation given:

- **Learning Rust with relational algebra** by Artur Pawelczyk

The presentation was focused on learning Rust by implementation of relational database in Rust. The presentation, despite not being as good as the ones I have seen in the previous meetups,
was quite interesting and gave a lot of interesting insights into Rust's way of writing code. I think it was also a great opportunity for the presenter to expand his oratory skills and I hope he will continue to do so.

## Networking

As usually during the meetup I am not very good at networking, but during the activities such as quizzes and discussion-time I managed to talk to a few people. I hope to get better at this in the future and practice more during the next meetup, which will take place
next week.

## Summary

I think the meetup was great and I am looking forward to the next one. I was really impressed by the office of Air Space Intelligence and I hope that they will continue to host the meetups in the future. Given my current experience and student status, I don't think 
I would be able to work there (I would really like to though!) but I am sure that it is a great place for people who are more experienced and are looking for a job. The Rust meetup community is really great and I am happy to attend these meetups.

I hope to use this motivation towards Rust to continue my learning and maybe even try to work on my Advent of Code solutions in Rust this year. I think it would be a great opportunity to learn more about the language and its features. If you are wondering if this meetup is worth attended,
I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in Rust and is looking for a community to learn from and share their knowledge with.
